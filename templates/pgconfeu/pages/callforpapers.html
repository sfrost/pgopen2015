                               <li>The first step to submit your proposal is to set up, or review for returning speakers, your speaker profile <a href="https://postgresopen.org/events/speakerprofile/pgopen2015/">here</a>.
                                  This system uses the PostgreSQL Community Auth system (the same system used by the PostgreSQL wiki, CommitFest, and pgconf.eu).  Log in
                                  to the system with your PostgreSQL Community Auth credentials.  Please note that while this is the same code, the speaker profiles are
                                  not shared between pgconf.eu and postgresopen.org.</li>

                               <li>Once you've created your profile, this page will provide a link to a form where you can submit your
                                  talks for PostgresOpen 2015. When the site prompts for a login, use your
                                  regular postgresql.org community account.  Should you already have your speaker profile, you can go to
                                  the talk submission page directly <a href="https://postgresopen.org/events/callforpapers/pgopen2015/">here.</a>
